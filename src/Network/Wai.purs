-- | The reason for using MonadEffect as a contraint is to 
-- | have the user control how they want their logic to run sequential/parallel.

-- | TO-CONSIDER:
-- | Need to expose the node Response in a case where 
-- | we need to process something that requires HttpIncomingRequest 
-- | from http lib. However, It would be preferrable to have that handle be polymorphic
-- | in a situation where we would like to support http2. Maybe existential type can help us here?
