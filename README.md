## WAI `Application`
WAI represents request/response flow, referred to as `Application`, as a simple CPS function. An `Application` will accept a request and a continuation function that asynchronously performs the response. If the continuation function successfully sends the response, a `ResponseReceived` value is returned. 

```purescript
type Application = Request -> (Response -> Aff ResponseReceived) -> Aff ResponseReceived
```

## WAI `Middleware`
By composing two `Application`s we can model a `Middleware`. This gives the ability to transform/inspect the request/response before it is delagated to the main `Application`. 

```purescript
type Middleware = Application -> Application

-- Creating 'Response' from a string
-- This function is provided by this library. 
responseStr :: Status -> ResponseHeaders -> String -> Response

myCustomMiddleware :: Middleware 
myCustomMiddleware app req send 
    | validatTokenHeader req = app req send 
    | otherwise              = send $ responseStr badRequest400 [] "Invalid Token!"
    where 
        validatTokenHeader :: Request -> Boolean
        validatTokenHeader req = ...
```

Because we are modelling the middleware as a function we can just compose more middleware onto one another â€” this means that we can control the order of the middlewares based on how we compose the functions.

```purescript
type Middleware = Application -> Application

middlewares :: Middleware 
middlewares = myCustomMiddleware1 >>> myCustomMiddleware2

myCustomMiddleware1 :: Middleware 
myCustomMiddleware1 app1 app2 = ...

myCustomMiddleware2 :: Middleware 
myCustomMiddleware app1 app2 = ...
```
